        m_Untranslated: 'Back in the Base Layer, right click the Idle animation and
          select "Make Transition" to make a transition from Idle to Locomotion.
          Select the transition. Turn off "Has Exit Time" and add the condition "Speed
          Greater 0.01". Do the same from Locomotion to Idle, but change the condition
          to "Speed Less 0.01".


          If you hit play you can now move around
          using the arrow keys or the joystick. Use shift or right trigger to run.
          You can only move forwards though, and that''s not much of a game. The
          next lesson will explain how to turn the character using root motion as
          well.




          Toptip:

          You might be wondering why we don''t
          add the Idle animation to our blend tree. Blending Idle and Walk animations
          can lead to the character taking very small steps at very tiny speeds,
          which is likely to cause feet-sliding. Besides, if you think about how
          your own body moves, you''re not really "blending" between moving and not
          moving, you''re "transitioning" from one to the other.'
