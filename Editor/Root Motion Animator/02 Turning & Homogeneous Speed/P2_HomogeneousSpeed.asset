      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'Select the walk blend tree. Under the "Adjust Time Scale"
          option, select "Homogeneous Speed". Do the same for the run blend tree.
          This readjusts the time scale of all your animations so they have the same
          speed.


          Play now and you''ll notice the character arcing a lot
          smoother. Designing your blend trees like this allows you to mix and match
          any animation whilst ensuring smooth motion, so make sure to use it alot
          if you want to use root motion in your own game.


          You may find
          the character turning smoothly but still taking a long time to turn around
          completely. In the next lesson you''ll add pivoting so the character will
          feel even better to control.




          Toptip:

          You may wonder
          why we are using turn -1 and 1 instead of -180 and 180 (representing degrees).
          The reason we use turn -1 and 1 is so you can reuse the value for other
          animations. If you have an animation set where the character turns really
          slow then you can use "Turn 1" to make the character turn 20 degrees per
          second. You could technically still do this if your turn value went between
          -180 and 180,  but clamping it between -1 and 1 makes your animator controllers
          easier to reason about.'
