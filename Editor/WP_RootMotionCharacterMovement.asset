    m_Untranslated: 'Welcome to the root motion character movement tutorial!




      By
      the end of this tutorial you will have created a third person character that
      uses root motion character movement, respecting clean practices, that grants
      you full creative flexibility.


      Root motion is defined as the motion
      of an animations root bone. Think of it as animated motion, where the animation
      decides when and how the character moves. Whilst this tutorial focuses on humanoids,
      it should be applicable to all animated motion.




      Animations and models
      are all provided. It is assumed you are familiar with the Unity interface.


      If
      you''d like to open this window again later, you can find it under Tutorials
      > Welcome Dialog.'
